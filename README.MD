# Jlang Programming Language
 This is a project that is greatly inspired by the programming language [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) created by the streamer and youtuber Tsoding. You may find his
 Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDaily) and his Twitch [here](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding).

 The purpose of the language is to understand how a language is created.

 As I am lacking experience in Python, I decided to use it for the early stages of the compiler.
